Project 1- Photography


###Macro

Study a piece of architecture and photograph it from different viewpoints

You should aim to take on board the principles we will cover and you have researched into consideration.

Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.

All of your images should be uploaded to your Flickr account with a clear link from your Design Journal to the set.

Consider the story behind the images, what are you trying to say to the viewer?

###Micro

Photograph a series of small, individual details from the building you photographed.

Consider how these items are photographed, retain a consistency in your approach.

Follow the same guidelines as those for the Macro series.

Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.



# Research


> “For me, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.” Henri Cartier-Bresson

"Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all designers need to master." Through my following research I will discover photographers that inspire and challenge me to push the way I view photo's  and also gaining skills and tips in taking my own photographs with these added skills.

Rules to look out for when taking a photograph:

### The Rule of Thirds-

The basic principle behind the rule of thirds is to imagine breaking an image down into thirds, both horizontally and vertically so that you have 9 parts.

![rule-of-thirds](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6109897/24987002-b076-11e4-8a87-911f33078b05.jpg)



An example with an image:

![slide056-590x443](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/7430175/d8a4aca8-f006-11e4-861f-b0b2f64d3a77.jpg)

These four points are the 4 main points of interest and the theory is that the viewer of the image will interact with the image more naturally and smoothly.


### Keep your horizontals, horizontal-

If in the image being shot has any vertical lines e.g a horizon the lines have to be kept horizontal or the image will not look right.

An example of this:

![horizontal-lines-2-600x460](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/7430200/2c5361a0-f007-11e4-9580-6c79a8afd01c.jpg)

As you can see the line on the road has stayed horizontal and keeps the image looking balanced.


### Looking for fresh angles-

lying on the ground with a look up shot, tilting the camera just experiment. More interesting! 

An example of this:

![v06_ext_look_up_shot_lr1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/7430240/d4b18ce6-f007-11e4-87cf-facfe13ebf70.jpg)

this shot looks more modern and interesting because its not a boring straight on shot. It is more experimentive and pushing the rules of photography.


### Fill the frame-

filling the frame of a shot can make a very interesting image. rather than just having the image half the frame why not have it the whole frame. This is a great skill to have as it can have a great affect on the photo's being took.

An example of this:

![fill_the_frame_pavo_cristatus](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/7430268/5c26bbf6-f008-11e4-8c89-6a400a22c684.jpg)

This photo is much more appealing looking at it has the whole frame filled with its image, rather than just a image with white space.

#Photographers that inspire me

##Dan Rubin

![danrubin_1406993287_83](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6023543/3c36a200-abbd-11e4-8683-ffd0ab25eade.jpg)


Dan Rubin was born in Miami Beach and is now living in London. Dan is a designer, photographer, and founder and creative director of Webgraph which is a multi-disciplinary studio based in the US.

What interests me about Dan Rubin is he can take such focused and professional photos through only using his IPhone and different IPhone photo apps. This inspires me because not only can we try it ourselves but he shows videos on how to achieve the most from your iPhone camera and different tips and tricks on exposure and lighting.

When I first seen Dan Rubin’s Photographs I didn't think they were took through an iPhone camera as they have such focus and the way he captures the lightening makes his photographs unique and every one of them tells a story.

Instagram: http://instagram.com/danrubin/

Each photograph is thought out carefully as each photograph represents a story. An example of this is in the second photograph, as he has  a high angle shot of his camera which has also taken a photograph of its own angle of the landscape in front creating a beautiful detailed photograph.

Each photo is so clear and crisp which makes them so easy to look at. The last photo uses a lot of emotion through the colour and lighting used to represent the story. I also like how the water is used as a reflection in the last one to form a mirror which works as it makes the water look the same as the sky. I also like the way he has used the lighting in this picture to make the monument the form of light and the trees capture some of the light to cause the reflection in the water.

Overall Dan Rubin's skills in my own opinion are clever as he has taught me light, colour and the way in which to angle your camera to tell a different story. Also you don’t need a fancy camera to take an amazing image.


## Trashand
![illroots-portraits-trashhand](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6045936/cf70df44-ac95-11e4-89e1-67de9a596a43.png)

My second Photographer choice is called by the nickname **"Trashhand"** (real name Serdar Ozturk) Trashhand is also a very popular photographer on Instagram and only uses his limits of an iPhone camera when uploading to his Instagram feed. I love how his urban exploration has become his trademark and he is known for exploring Chicago and showing it off in the beautiful images he uploads.

Instagram: http://instagram.com/trashhand

I picked these three photos as they are my  favourites from his Instagram collection and they caught my eye. I feel all three connect through the same mood. They are all taken at night time which automatically makes the lights in the photographs stand out and become more intense and gives each photograph a sense of movement.

I also like the use of colour used on especially the last photo as I like the way the light is represented as the fast cars and the movement of them throughout the city. It reminds me of when I use to squint my eyes at the lamp post lights at night and it created a blurred light shadow like the ones in this picture.

##Elena Kalis

![elena-kalis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6110235/3b75d790-b078-11e4-8e61-ca4e1347e1af.jpeg)


Elena Kalis is a underwater photographer based in the Bahamas.

I picked this photographer as I find her underwater picks mesmerising to look at and she makes each photograph beautiful and meaningful. I feel each photo captures a story and each girl in the photograph portrays a certain mood which gives an audience a connection to each photo. It gives me the impression of a dreamlike, weightless atmosphere. I have always found the underwater world interesting and seeing these photos makes me love it even more.

images from: http://www.elenakalisphoto.com/about/

I love how each photo is so crisp and detailed and in most of them you cant tell they are taken underwater except for the bubbles through out the water. The poses of the models are elegant and the way in which the angle of the camera is each model has a different story.

#My Photo's

Final picked photos can be veiwed on my [flikr Album]. (https://www.flickr.com/photos/128349074@N08/sets/72157652453157972)


##Some examples of my photo's:

##St Patricks

The first destination I picked was St Patricks church. I picked this because i have always liked the shape of the church from the outside. i picked a clear sunny day to do my photographs on, as a result to this my photographs capture strong light which makes them crisp and clear looking.

#Project 2- Illustration

For my book covers I had a few ideas on what type of designers I wanted to find and research. I like simple, limited colour book covers with a simple design. I will also show designers other designers that I find interesting as i'm still unsure in the design i want to go for on my own book covers.

##Melissa Rathbone

My first designer is Melissa Rathbone as I like the simplicity of her work and I think she uses the "less is more" quote perfectly.


![screen shot 2015-03-06 at 11 34 58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6524874/84fc55a6-c3f6-11e4-899e-9d3850415ecd.png)

![screen shot 2015-03-06 at 11 34 44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6524876/8640dd1a-c3f6-11e4-96af-8287b23c3dd3.png)

I also like how she uses type to make a shape as this works really well against the book colour and the type looks like a shadow of peach and the audience will be able to indicate straight away what the object is meant to be.

![screen shot 2015-03-06 at 11 35 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6524871/82153bb4-c3f6-11e4-9703-faa04924c79b.png)

http://melissa-rathbone.tumblr.com/roalddahlbookcovers

I enjoy looking at her work as she uses simple icons and uses a limit colour palette to portray a meaning and creates a mood with each cover. Even tho she uses simple shapes the audience can indicate straight away what book cover Melissa is creating which i think is a great skill to have as a designer.


##Noma Bar


Noma Bar is a graphic designer and his challenge was to  create a range of 10 books by Don DeLillo.

I enjoy the visual effect these books have as they are very graphic and bright. I also enjoy how their is limited detail, but this works with the shapes and colour used. He also uses certain shapes to represent an object which then links with the title of the book. I this style as I feel it works really well with the colours and style of the book.

I also like how all the colours link together as a set creating a house style with all the books having a house style.

##Christian Jackson

Christian Jackson created a series of hyper-minimalist book cover designs for a myriad of classic children’s stories we’ve grown to know and love.

I enjoy how these covers use features from the story to represent it on the front as the main feature. He has used some smart shapes to create a part of the story that can make the audiance guess the story straight away with out needing to know the title.

I also like how the shapes are just simple lines and circles and how he has used limited design to create the overall design.

##Caroline Bickford Smith

A perfect example of this is Caroline Bickfords horror cover designs.

I love how every book cover different yet all similar in a house style. This is through colour. I like how she has only limited her self to 2 main colour's and this has a impact through her book covers.

![horror boobs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6644237/36f92988-c9aa-11e4-9cbd-05f5755bc571.png)

More book covers designed by Caroline was her penguin books Great Food series which are vibrent with colour. This is a turn from her other design with her horror books. I like how she has the main shape to describe the object from the kitchen with typography in the centre. I also like the pattern work used.

![great-food-penguin-books-coralie-bickford-smith-covers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6835708/61f21c10-d334-11e4-804e-7587219d8bb5.jpg)

I have been in love with these cover redesigns since I seen them. The cloth bound editions are beautifully designed.

![penguin-classics-clothbound-hardback-spines-258x300](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6835709/632b568c-d334-11e4-9695-a6ee4d7bbc4c.jpg)

I also like how the side of the book all link together when you have them as a set sitting as this will make the audience want them all as they all link together.

#My book covers

To start off i did some sketches in my sketch book to gave me an idea of what way i wanted each cover to look like.

#Project 3- Data Visualisation 

We were given the task of creating an Infographic displaying data on world population. To start this task of I collected a series of screenshots to give me a rough idea of the layout I wanted and also what type of style and colour I wanted to go for. I then wrote down the important information from each to collect my own data together on what would be important to add into my own.
 
 We were giving the link to the website: http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/ to use the data information of world population to design are Infographic on.  
  
Below are some examples of other infographics that I have found while doing research;

I like the style of the map and the pointers on the map.
