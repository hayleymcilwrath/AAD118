# Project 1 - Macro & Micro



###Macro

Study a piece of architecture and photograph it from different viewpoints

You should aim to take on board the principles we will cover and you have researched into consideration.

Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.

All of your images should be uploaded to your Flickr account with a clear link from your Design Journal to the set.

Consider the story behind the images, what are you trying to say to the viewer?

###Micro

Photograph a series of small, individual details from the building you photographed.

Consider how these items are photographed, retain a consistency in your approach.

Follow the same guidelines as those for the Macro series.

Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.



# Research


> “For me, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.” Henri Cartier-Bresson

Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all designers need to master. Through my following research I will discover photographers that inspire and challenge me to push the way I view photo's  and also I can gain skills and tips in taking my own photographs with these added skills.

rules to look out for when taking a photograph:

* The Rule of Thirds-
The basic principle behind the rule of thirds is to imagine breaking an image down into thirds, both horizontally and vertically so that you have 9 parts.

![rule-of-thirds](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6109897/24987002-b076-11e4-8a87-911f33078b05.jpg)

####picture from:http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/

These four points are the 4 main points of interest and the theory is that the viewer of the image will interact with the image more naturally.


* Keep your horizontals, horizontal-
If in the image being shot has any vertical lines e.g a horizon the lines have to be kept horizontal or the image will not look right.


* Looking for fresh angles-
lying on the ground with a look up shot, tilting the camera just experiment. More interesting!


* Fill the frame-
filling the frame of a shot can make a very interesting image.

#Photographers that inspire me
##Dan Rubin

![danrubin_1406993287_83](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/6023543/3c36a200-abbd-11e4-8683-ffd0ab25eade.jpg)


Dan Rubin was born in Miami Beach and is now living in London. Dan is a designer, photographer, and founder and creative director of Webgraph which is a multi-disciplinary studio based in the US.

What interests me about Dan Rubin is he can take such focused and professional photos through only using his IPhone and different IPhone photo apps. This inspires me because not only can we try it ourselves but he shows videos on how to achieve the most from your iphone camera and different tips and tricks on exposure and lighting.

When I first seen Dan Rubins Photographs I didn't once think they were took through an iphone camera as they have such focus and the way he captures the lightening makes his photographs unique and every one of them tells a story.

Also we can see when taking a photograph a lot of thought is put in as in each photograph it represents a story. for example the second one is took at a high angle looking down so the camera is the main focus and we can see he has then used that camera to take a photo of what it see from its angle creating a beautiful detailed photograph.

Each photo is so clear and crisp which makes them so easy to look at. The last photo uses a lot of emotion through the colour used to represent the story. I also like how the water is used as a reflection in the last one to form a mirror which works as it makes the water look the same  as the sky. I also like the way he has used the lighting in this picture to make the monument the form of light and the trees capture some of the light to cause the reflection in the water.

Overall Dan Rubin's skills in my own opinion are clever as he has taught me light, colour and the way in which to angle your camera to tell a different story. Also you don’t need a fancy camera to take an amazing image.




## Trashand

My second Photographer choice is called by the nickname **"Trashhand"** (real name Serdar Ozturk) Trashhand is also a very popular photographer on Instagram and only uses his limits of an iPhone camera when uploading to his Instagram feed. I love how his urban exploration has become his trademark and he is known for exploring Chicago and showing it off in the beautiful images he uploads.

I picked these three photos as they are my main favourites of his Instagram collection and they caught my eye. I feel all three connect through the same mood. They are all taken at night time which automatically makes the lights in the photographs stand out and become more intense and gives each photograph a sense of movement.

I also like the use of colour used on especially the last photo as I like the way the light is represented as the fast cars and the movement of them throughout the city. it reminds me oh when I use to squint my eyes at night at the lamp posts and ut use to form a blurred light shadow like the ones in this picture.

##Elena Kalis

Elena Kalis is a underwater photographer based in the Bahamas.

I picked this photographer as I find her underwater picks mesmerising to look at and she makes each photograph beautiful and meaningful. I feel each photo captures a story and each girl in the photograph portrays a certain mood which gives an audience a connection to each photo. It gives me the impression of a dreamlike, weightless atmosphere. I have always found the underwater world interesting and seeing these photos makes me love it even more.

#My Photo's

After carrying out my research and gaining as much photography tips as I possibly could I decided it was time to go out and take my own approach on photography. I developed on Dan Rubin's camera angles and Trash hands lighting skills and tried to take these skills and protray this through my own photographs.
